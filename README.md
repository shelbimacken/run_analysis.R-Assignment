This project takes data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set (<http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>) and turns it into a tidy data set for the purposes of the course assignment.

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- README.txt
- Codebook.Rmd - Markdown for the codebook
- Codebook.html - easily readable format for codebook
- run_analysis.R - Script to create the tidyData.txt
- tidyData.txt - Tidy data set created
